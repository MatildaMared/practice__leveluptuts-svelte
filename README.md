# Practice - Svelte

This is a small project practising fundamental Svelte concepts. The result is a small quiz app that gets its data from [Open Trivia](https://opentdb.com/). The project is based on a tutorial from [Level Up Tutorials](https://leveluptutorials.com/tutorials) called "Svelte for beginners".

## What I learned 👩‍🎓

For me, the main learning opportunities in this project was:

1. Gaining a deeper understanding of fundamental Svelte concepts.
2. How to work with reactive statements and variables
3. Become more familiar with the Svelte templating language

## Continued development ✏️

There is a lot of things you could do with this app! 😊 For starters, I have barely focused on styling at all. You could also improve a lot on the quiz itself, perhaps let the visitor choose the amount of questions, set up a scoreboard or even make it a fullstack application with the ability to register as a user or make your own quizzes.
